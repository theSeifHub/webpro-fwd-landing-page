## Initial Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, get `landing-page` project files from [udacity/fend](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019) repo, then open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/).

## Use Completed Project

Download completed project code from this page, then open `index.html` in your browser and start interacting with the page.

Notice how active states of page sections and navigation menu links change while scrolling, and how the window scrolls to the requested section when its navigation link is clicked.
